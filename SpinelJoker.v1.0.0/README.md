# ðŸŽ´ Spinel Joker Mod for Balatro

A custom Joker mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2269430/Balatro/) made using [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods). I love Spinel.

## ðŸ”® Joker Details

- **Name**: Spinel  
- **Rarity**: Legendary  
- **Cost**: 6  
- **Effect**:  
  - Starts with **x6 Mult**
  - **Scoring 4 Aces** permanently adds an extra x6 Mult, so that makes it x12, x18, x24, etc.


## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Install Lovely and Steamodded for Balatro.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Place it inside the `Mods` folder. It should look like this: "%appdata%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods"
4. Check the mod loader in-game and see if the mod is enabled or not.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `j_spinel.lua` â€“ Joker logic
- `j_spinel.png` â€“ Joker card sprite, there's two of these in the assets folder, the 71x95 px in the 1x folder, and 142x190 px in the 2x folder.
- `README.md` â€“ This file

## ðŸ§  Strategy

Stack multipliers by intentionally scoring hands with 4 Aces. I suggest you find a DNA or Death Tarot.

## ðŸ–Œ Art Credit

Me (FirstTry) actually, I drew the Spinel myself but the joker card art like the template, objects, and font, it all belongs to Localthunk.
